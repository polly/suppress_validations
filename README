SuppressValidations
===================

Allows you to temporarily disable validations for any ActiveRecord object,
mainly intended for use in script/console, though it might possibly be somewhat
usefull in unit tests as well.

Example
=======

class SomeModel < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates_presence_of :some_attribute
end



include SuppressValidations

some_model = SomeModel.new
some_model.save # -> false


suppress_validations do
    some_model.save # -> true
end
